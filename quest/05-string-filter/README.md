## Quest 05: String Filter
### Task
Develop a simple program that accepts five strings as input, tests if they're suffixed with the target suffix, then shows the results in the console.

### Details
* The maximum length of strings is arbitrary, but it's advised to be higher than 16 and lower than 512.
* If strings don't match the criteria, there isn't a need to show them in the console.
* Example output:
```
Write a string (127 chars max): orchard
Write a string (127 chars max): club house
Write a string (127 chars max): farmer
Write a string (127 chars max): Bloomberg
Write a string (127 chars max): stetson

Suffix "er" is found in string: farmer
```

### Requirements
* (optional) Let the process be case-incensitive.
