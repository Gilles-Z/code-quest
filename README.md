## Code Quest
Honestly, I had no idea I'm going to create this repo, but since there are some people asking me to give them some directions on learning programming languages, well...

So, here is a collection of quests, each may be a problem people asked me to write examples on, or something I want to test on myself. If you're new to programming and want something to try out, feel free to complete these challenges yourself. Oh, and beware of the overall broniness.

Just check the `quest` directory, you'll see what the quests are about.

In case you're wondering, I'm not writing in either Python or PHP.
